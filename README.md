#Description
PORTALS stands for Portable Offline Reading Tool And Library System. The CE
stands for Comic Edition. I started this project because I have had no luck
finding a FREE, user-friendly comic book archive reader with extensive
functionality for Windows. While Comix works well for Unix systems and
SimpleComic for Mac OS X, Windows is lacking in decent comic book readers.

The goal of this project is to develop a fully-functional and user-friendly
comic book archive reader and make it available to all who wish to use. By
developing PORTALS-CE entirely in Java, I can take advantage of the JVM and
run PORTALS-CE on all three major Operating Systems with minimal tweaks
between versions.

#Functionality that I hope to include:
- Reading and displaying CBR, CBZ, PDF, JPG, and PNG files.
- Displaying one or two pages at once.
- Fullscreen capability.
- Forward and reverse image flow.
- Temporary page rotation for viewing purposes.
- Zooming in and out by percentage.
- Controls for mouse and keyboard.

#Features that I hope to include:
- Import CBR, CBZ and PDF files into a library.
- Display and sort files by Title, Author, Publication Date, Import Date, etc.
- Delete imported files from library.
- Ability to favorite files and sort by ranking.
- Ability to edit metadata and convert between CBR, CBZ and PDF.
- Ability to merge individual JPG and PNG images into CBR, CBZ, and PDF.
- Ability to sort the library with folders.

#Long term goals:
I hope to develop a new format for comic book archives that manages metadata
better than the current comic book archive formats. I also hope to be able
to convert CBR, CBZ, PDF, JPG and PNG files into this new format.

Initially the GUI for this project will probably incorporate the Java Swing
library, but I plan to learn and utilize JavaFX for a more aesthetic GUI.

Ultimately, this project is a massive learnign experience for me and I am
thankful for the opportunity to share it with you. If you would like to alpha
and/or beta test this program (when ready) please contact me via email:
